# sCCA
Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis

Functions, simulation models and data analysis performed as part of the CCA paper

(A) sCCA Functions
  - ConvCCA
  - RelPMDCCA
  - PMDCCA was implemented through package (PMA)
  - Multiple sCCA for ConvCCA and RelPMDCCA
(B) Data generating models
  - Simple (two or more)
  - Single latent variable model (two or more)
  - Covariance-based model
(C) Simulation studies
  - Performing them
  - Obtaining results
  - Measures: Corr, Loss, Angle, AUC
  - Orthogonality and Sparsity
(D) Data analysis
  - Description of data
  - Implementing sCCA on them
  - Measures: Accuracy, Precision, Recall
(E) Plots
